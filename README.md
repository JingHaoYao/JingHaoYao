- :wrench: I'm currently building a new cutting-edge game engine for a third-person multiplayer game. I've built systems for 3D geometry, physics, rendering and player movement, all while rigorously optimizing my code to support a large dynamic world.
- :space_invader: I also make ambitious games as a hobby, with my biggest project being [Frigid Blackwaters](https://github.com/Frigid-Team/frigid-blackwaters-nurtured-code).
- :mortar_board: I received a B.E. of Software Engineering in 2023 from the University of Waterloo. My co-ops ranged from indie to AAA studios.
- :pencil2: I draw and animate pixel art. Every piece of pixel art you see on this GitHub was drawn by me. 
- :seedling: Currently learning to be a better game designer. Humbled so far. *Designing Games* by Tynan Sylvester was foundational to me. 
- :video_game: My favorite games are *Elden Ring*, *Minecraft*, *Don't Starve*, *Civ VI*, *Cyberpunk 2077* and *CrossCode*. Currently playing *Wildermyth*.
- :books: My favorite book is *Flow* by Mihaly Csikzentmihalyi. Currently reading *Creativity* by the same author.
